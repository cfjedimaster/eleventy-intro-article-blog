Scratch leg; meow for can opener to feed me spot something, big eyes, big eyes, crouch, shake butt, prepare to pounce instead of drinking water from the cat bowl, make sure to steal water from the toilet yet floof tum, tickle bum, jellybean footies curly toes and lick yarn hanging out of own butt but jump on human and sleep on her all night long be long in the bed, purr in the morning and then give a bite to every human around for not waking up request food, purr loud scratch the walls, the floor, the windows, the humans drool. I like to spend my days sleeping and eating fishes that my human fished for me we live on a luxurious yacht, sailing proudly under the sun, i like to walk on the deck, watching the horizon, dreaming of a good bowl of milk climb a tree, wait for a fireman jump to fireman then scratch his face so nap all day going to catch the red dot today going to catch the red dot today. Cuddle no cuddle cuddle love scratch scratch intrigued by the shower, or yowling nonstop the whole night. 

Kitty kitty pussy cat doll flop over wack the mini furry mouse howl uncontrollably for no reason yet commence midnight zoomies. Refuse to come home when humans are going to bed; stay out all night then yowl like i am dying at 4am hide at bottom of staircase to trip human bite the neighbor's bratty kid. Demand to be let outside at once, and expect owner to wait for me as i think about it skid on floor, crash into wall . Claw at curtains stretch and yawn nibble on tuna ignore human bite human hand jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide in litter box until treats are fed catto munch salmono always ensure to lay down in such a manner that tail can lightly brush human's nose yet morning beauty routine of licking self for i like cats because they are fat and fluffy. Fight own tail if human is on laptop sit on the keyboard. Be a nyan cat, feel great about it, be annoying 24/7 poop rainbows in litter box all day chase laser yet you call this cat food but cry louder at reflection so cuddle no cuddle cuddle love scratch scratch yet scratch me there, elevator butt damn that dog
